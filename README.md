The XG football game website has been designed for two purposes. Firstly, to educate and inform about the concept of Expected Goals in football matches. It does this through an explanation on the rules page and through playing the game itself. Secondly, to entertain football fans and computer game fans with a fun, luck-based football simulation.

### Could Have ###

All the Must Have and Should Have User Stories were fully completed with all features included. Elements of the Could Have Story were completed. The game does use a modal to give you a score at the end to make competition with yourself possible in the game. This could easily be screenshotted and shared with friends to make competition amongst other people possible. Creating a more advanced leaderboard would be a further feature to extend this website in the future. 

## Features ##
This website includes a number of features to reach the aims of teaching about XG and providing an enjoyable gaming experience.

### Navbar and Footer ###
The navbar is simple to avoid ditracting from the game itself. As a result, it did not need to have a dropdown menu. It does include:
    - A Title (Football XG Game)
    - A sound button to toggle sound on and off
    - A link to go to the game page
    - A link to go to the rules page

The footer is also kept simple for the same reasons. It includes: 
    - A Title (Football XG Game)
    - Copywrite information
    - A link to the author's GitHub page

### Welcome Modal ###
The welcome modal appears when the website is loaded <strong> for the first time </strong>. This is necessary as it would be annoying if it appeared every time the game was loaded (or, for example, when returning from the rules page). It gives a brief outline of the game to entice users. It gives the option of navigating straight to the game or to go to the rules page for more information. It also encourages users to turn the sound on as this aids overall user experience when playing.

### Rules Page ###
The rules page gives the user more information about XG as well as explaining the rules of the game. This page is kept simple to ensure users can gain the infomation they need as quickly as they can before experiencing the game itself.

### Information Section ###
This section was included on the top left of the screen as it is the key information players need to know when playing the game, particularly the number of goals they have scored and the time remaining so thy know how long they have left. The statistics update as the game is being played.

### Buttons ###
The buttons appear at the top in the middle on larger screens, but appear at the bottom (below the pitch) on smaller screens. This is because when holding a device such as a phone and being required to tap buttons, you do not want your hand to cover important information on the screen. The game buttons are grey at points in the game when they are disabled. When they are enabled, they appear green and a cursor hovering over them will change to the 'pointer' symbol. 

The start button changes message once a game has begun so that a player is aware that they will be restarting a game if they click on it. An alert also appears at this stage to ensure the player genuinely means to restart their game and lose their current score.

### Commentary ###
The commentary section was added towards the end of the project to aid user experience and make the movement of the ball in the game clearer, particularly for users not playing with sound on (where goals are indicated by crowd noise). The commentary changes depending on the button that has been pressed and the result that has occured.
