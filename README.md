The XG football game website has been designed for two purposes. Firstly, to educate and inform about the concept of Expected Goals in football matches. It does this through an explanation on the rules page and through playing the game itself. Secondly, to entertain football fans and computer game fans with a fun, luck-based football simulation.

All the Must Have and Should Have User Stories were fully completed with all features included. Elements of the Could Have Story were completed. The game does use a modal to give you a score at the end to make competition with yourself possible in the game. This could easily be screenshotted and shared with friends to make competition amongst other people possible. Creating a more advanced leaderboard would be a further feature to extend this website in the future. 

## Features ##
This website includes a number of features to reach the aims of teaching about XG and providing an enjoyable gaming experience.

### Navbar and Footer ###
The navbar is simple to avoid ditracting from the game itself. As a result, it did not need to have a dropdown menu. It does include:
    - A Title (Football XG Game)
    - A sound button to toggle sound on and off
    - A link to go to the game page
    - A link to go to the rules page

### Welcome Modal ###
The welcome modal appears when the website is loaded <strong> for the first time </strong>. This is necessary as it would be annoying if it appeared every time the game was loaded (or, for example, when returning from the rules page). It gives a brief outline of the game to entice users. It gives the option of navigating straight to the game or to go to the rules page for more information. It also encourages users to turn the sound on as this aids overall user experience when playing.

### Rules Page ###
The rules page gives the user more information about XG as well as explaining the rules of the game. This page is kept simple to ensure users can gain the infomation they need as quickly as they can before experiencing the game itself.
