The XG football game website has been designed for two purposes. Firstly, to educate and inform about the concept of Expected Goals in football matches. It does this through an explanation on the rules page and through playing the game itself. Secondly, to entertain football fans and computer game fans with a fun, luck-based football simulation.

All the Must Have and Should Have User Stories were fully completed with all features included. Elements of the Could Have Story were completed. The game does use a modal to give you a score at the end to make competition with yourself possible in the game. This could easily be screenshotted and shared with friends to make competition amongst other people possible. Creating a more advanced leaderboard would be a further feature to extend this website in the future. 

## Features ##
This website includes a number of features to reach the aims of teaching about XG and providing an enjoyable gaming experience.

### Navbar and Footer ###
The navbar is simple to avoid ditracting from the game itself. As a result, it did not need to have a dropdown menu. It does include:
    - A Title (Football XG Game)
    - A sound button to toggle sound on and off
    - A link to go to the game page
    - A link to go to the rules page
